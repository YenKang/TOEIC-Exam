newspaper advertisements, 
Internet job search websites, 
and personal recommendations.

Give reasons or examples to support your opinion.
```

## Part3 Answer
I will elaborate the four reason why the personal recommendation is best way to get the job in software company.

First, proficiency is the big factor to recruit the employee. Many people would exaggerate their ability on the resume. 
As a result, personally recommendation is an relatively efficient way to fiilter out those are not qualified with the position.

Secondly, personality is also an essential in the working environment. In software company domain, the community skill is important because it is frequent to collaborate with colleagues. Thus, if the personality of the applicant does not fit the company's culture. It would cause the obstacle of  the company's operation.
Thus, it is the better way to understand the personality and the core value via employee's reference than via the only one resume. 

Third, the candidate who apply for the job via personal recommendation has higher successful rate to get the offers compared to those who just sumbit the resume or CV to the company. Futhermore, the human resource recruiter also carefully states that the company has the higher priority to review the resume of the applicants who were recommended by the internal works.

Fourth, personal recommendation has higher credibility than only the CV. To be more specific,
many people would fake the personal information or technical knowledge. Thus, the company often take much time to verify the authenrity of CV information. Thus, personal recommendation is a better solution to idenify the truth of applicant's information.

The fifth factor is the personal record. The company can get more details and information about the application. Knowing more personal information can lower the risk for the company. For example, if a applicant who has the data leak history, it has higher rate to explore the comfidential data of data to the competitor.

To sum up, personal recommendation is an relatively effiecnet and reliable way to find the job.
